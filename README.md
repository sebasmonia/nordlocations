# Nordlocations

Small tool to lookup NordVPN servers and map them to a location. This could be a spreadsheet that I update every few months, but where's the fun in that!

Depends on [nodgui](https://www.autistici.org/interzona/nodgui.html), [dexador](https://github.com/fukamachi/dexador), [jonathan](https://github.com/Rudolph-Miller/jonathan), the NordVPN (servers API)[https://api.nordvpn.com/server] , and ArcGIS [REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-reverse-geocode.htm).
